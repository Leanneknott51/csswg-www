title: CSS To do list
---

Things I know need work, to save me raising GH issues for tiny bits.

* Spec tables - will also need a dark mode for the colors used
* Tables and lists in general, waiting to see what data we might have
* Fallbacks for older browsers, to do last of all
* We need some section navigation
* Tidy up the breakpoints and so on to make the responsiveness consistent
